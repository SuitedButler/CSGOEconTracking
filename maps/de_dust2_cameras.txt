// Each entry must have 5 numbers seperated by a space.
// The first three numbers are the X Y Z coordinates of where the camera sits.
// The 4th and 5th numbers are the PITCH and YAW of the cameras angles and is the direction that it points.
// To easily get camera angles, fly around the map and type "spec_pos" in the console.
// The console will return the 5 numbers that you need to paste into your entry below.
// More cameras is better.
